# Write a program that stores 3 sides of a cuboid as variables (float)
# The program should write the surface area and volume of the cuboid like:
# 
# Surface Area: 600
# Volume: 1000

a= 13
b= 7.5
c= 9

Area=(2*(a*b)+2*(a*c)+2*(b*c))
Volume=a*b*c

print('Surface Area: ', Area)
print('Volume: ', Volume)
